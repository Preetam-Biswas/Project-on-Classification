# Project-on-Classification
This project is an example of Supervised Machine Learning. We will create models to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

Since, the target variable here, "Subscription", is of categorical type, I have performed Logistic Regression to build the ML model.
Finally, I made my predictions using Decision Tree algorithm taking the mode of the values at the leaf node.
